# Flight Delay Prediction
This is a group work in my post-graduate program.

Project requirements: The file FlightDelays.csv contains information on all commercial flights that departed the Washington, D.C., area and arrived in New York in January 2004. For each flight, there is information on the departure and arrival airports, the distance of the route, the scheduled time and date of the flight, and so on. The variable that we are trying to predict is whether a flight is delayed. A delay is defined as an arrival that is at least 15 minutes later than scheduled.
